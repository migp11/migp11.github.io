## Computational Systems Biology and Data Science

I am a researcher in the life sciences, with expertise in systems biology, computational modeling, and data analysis.

Born and raised in <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/aFTLsKY2pmQrhZmL7">Montevideo, Uruguay</a>, I studied Biophysics and Computer Science, and later discovered how to connect my passions for biology and computing during my Master’s in Bioinformatics.

In 2011, I moved to Spain to pursue a PhD at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. In 2017, I joined the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, where I am now an established researcher in the Life Sciences Department.

My work combines computational modeling with experimental data to understand biological mechanisms and cell behavior. In recent years, I have also explored geo-spatial analysis and population mobility, investigating their impact on urban health and epidemic dynamics.

I have extensive experience as a software developer, building data-driven models and computational tools to support research in systems biology, epidemiology, and health policy.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, listening to music, and reading. I am also passionate about exploring nature—whether it’s the sea, mountains, forests, or any outdoor adventure.
